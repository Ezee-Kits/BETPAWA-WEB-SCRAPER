# Betpawa Betting Scraper

The **Betpawa Betting Scraper** automates the process of extracting betting data from the Betpawa platform. This script captures live odds for various football matches, providing crucial information for bettors.

## üìå Features

- **Real-Time Data Extraction**: Retrieves live betting data for upcoming football matches on Betpawa.
- **Efficient Scrolling**: Automatically scrolls through the webpage to load all match data.
- **CSV Output**: Outputs the extracted data in a structured CSV format for easy analysis.
- **Data Deduplication**: Removes duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the Selenium WebDriver to open the Betpawa website.
2. **Waiting for Elements**: It waits for specific elements on the page to load, ensuring data accuracy.
3. **Data Extraction**: The script captures match time, home team, away team, and odds for each match.
4. **Output**: The results are saved in a CSV file for further analysis.

### Key Components:

- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes Selenium for navigating the website and extracting data.
- **Data Structuring**: Organizes the scraped data into a dictionary format for easy saving.
- **CSV File Management**: Handles the creation and management of CSV files for output.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Before running the script, ensure the following packages are installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Selenium**
- **Pandas**

Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install selenium pandas
```
